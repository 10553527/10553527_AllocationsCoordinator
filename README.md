# 10553527_AllocationsCoordinator
This bespoke, web-based application; written in Python, is designed to randomly allocate students to hospitals based on a series of user-supplied values. The values are supplied through the application's front end along with a spreadsheet containing each hospitals' availability each week. Showcasing my knowledge of Python and HTML, this application uses dictionaries, lists and list comprehension, Jinja 2 and Bootstrap, error checking mechanisms, and the fundamental building blocks of programming to manipulate the inputted data, which is initially processed using the pandas software library. The data is passed between the front and back end through a Flask API. When the allocations are complete, they are written to a spreadsheet using the .csv module and returned to the user through the API.
This project was developed for a member of an operations team at a university to alleviate the burden of manually assigning students to hospitals in MS Excel, which was an error-prone, labour-intensive process.
